        This Privacy Policy explains how UTG.AI (“UTG.AI”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses,
        and shares information when you visit our website, interact with our content, or contact us
        about AI automation and related services.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 text-white">1.1 Information you provide to us</h3>
      <p>We collect information that you voluntarily provide, including when you:</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 text-white">1.2 Information collected automatically</h3>
      <p>
        When you visit our website, we automatically collect certain technical and usage information, such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2 md:ml-5">
        <li>IP address and approximate location (city/region level where available).</li>
        <li>Device information (browser type, operating system, device type).</li>
        <li>Pages viewed, links clicked, time spent on pages, and referring URLs.</li>
        <li>
          Information collected via cookies and similar technologies (such as pixels and tags), including the
          Meta/Facebook Pixel for analytics and advertising.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 text-white">1.3 Information from third-party tools</h3>
      <p>
        If you interact with us through integrated tools (e.g., Calendly bookings, analytics platforms,
        or automation platforms we use to process form submissions), those tools may share limited information
        with us such as your contact details, time zone, and meeting preferences.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect for purposes including:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2 md:ml-5">
        <li>Responding to inquiries and providing requested information or services.</li>
        <li>Preparing and discussing proposals, scopes, and automation plans.</li>
        <li>Scheduling and managing calls, demos, and follow-up communications.</li>
        <li>Improving and optimizing our website, content, and user experience.</li>
        <li>

      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">3. Legal Bases (Where Applicable)</h2>
      <p>
        Where required by law (for example, in the European Economic Area or the UK), we rely on one or more
        of the following legal bases to process your personal information:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2 md:ml-5">
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Consent</span> – when you voluntarily provide information or accept cookies.</li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Legitimate interests</span> – such as operating, improving, and securing our Services,
          and communicating with you as a business contact.
        </li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Contract</span> – when processing is necessary to perform or prepare a contract with you.</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Legal obligation</span> – when processing is required by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">4. Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies, pixels, and similar tracking technologies to understand how visitors use our website,
        measure performance, and support our marketing efforts.
      </p>
      <p>These may include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2 md:ml-5">
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Essential cookies</span> – required for basic site functionality.</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Analytics cookies</span> – to understand traffic, usage patterns, and performance.</li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Advertising pixels</span> – such as the Meta/Facebook Pixel, which helps us measure
          and optimize ad campaigns and create audiences.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can typically control cookies through your browser settings and, for some platforms like Facebook, through
        your ad preferences on those platforms. Disabling certain cookies may affect your experience on our website.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">5. How We Share Information</h2>
      <p>We may share your information with:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2 md:ml-5">
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Service providers</span> that help us operate our business
          (e.g., hosting, analytics, email, scheduling, CRM, automation platforms).
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Professional advisors</span> (such as legal or financial advisors)
          where reasonably necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Authorities or third parties</span> when required by law, court order,
          or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Business transfers</span> – if we are involved in a merger, acquisition,
          reorganization, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information in the traditional sense. If applicable law defines “sale” more broadly
        (for example, under certain U.S. state privacy laws), we will comply with those obligations separately.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy,
        unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. The retention period may vary depending
        on factors such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2 md:ml-5">
        <li>The length of our relationship with you as a prospect or client.</li>
        <li>Whether there is a legal obligation to retain certain data.</li>
        <li>The need to resolve disputes or enforce agreements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access,
        loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage
        is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">8. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Our service providers and partners may be located in different countries. As a result, your information may be
        stored or processed in a country that may have different data protection laws than your home jurisdiction.
        Where required, we take steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place for such transfers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">9. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2 md:ml-5">
        <li>The right to access and obtain a copy of your personal information.</li>
        <li>The right to request correction of inaccurate or incomplete information.</li>
        <li>The right to request deletion of your information, subject to legal obligations.</li>
        <li>
          The right to object to or restrict certain types of processing, including direct marketing.
        </li>
        <li>The right to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To exercise these rights, contact us using the details in the “Contact Us” section below. We may need to verify
        your identity before responding to your request.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our website and Services are not directed to children and are intended for business users and adults.
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16. If you believe a child
        has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">11. Third-Party Links</h2>
      <p>
        Our website may contain links to third-party websites, content, or services. We are not responsible for the
        privacy practices or content of those third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any
        third-party sites you visit.

      </p>
      <p>
        Your continued use of our website or Services after the updated Policy becomes effective means you acknowledge
        and accept the changes.
      </p>
